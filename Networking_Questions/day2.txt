1. Who owns DNS & can I change DNS?
The DNS (Domain Name System) is coordinated globally by ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers), which oversees how domain names map to IP addresses.
You can change the DNS server you use — for example, switching from your ISP’s DNS to Google DNS (8.8.8.8) or Cloudflare (1.1.1.1) by modifying settings on your device, operating system, or router.

2. How DNS handles a request
Resolver — Your device asks the configured DNS resolver for an IP.

Root server — Points to the correct Top-Level Domain (TLD) server (e.g., .com).

TLD server — Points to the authoritative name server for the domain.

Authoritative server — Provides the actual IP address.

Response — Resolver caches and returns the IP to your device.

3. Session (why a separate layer?)
The Session layer in networking ensures that long-running communications are maintained properly. It manages:

Opening and closing connections

Recovering from dropped connections

Keeping track of data flow between two systems
By separating it, developers can build applications without worrying about manually managing session details.

4. Connecting to Wi-Fi & sharing an existing IP
When multiple devices connect to the same Wi-Fi, they often share a single public IP address using NAT (Network Address Translation).
NAT maps each device’s private IP to the shared public IP so they can all access the internet without IP conflicts.

5. UTF-8 length
UTF-8 encodes characters using 1 to 4 bytes:

ASCII letters/numbers → 1 byte (a)

Special characters → more bytes (€ takes 3 bytes)

Some emojis → 4 bytes

6. Can we use HTTP with UDP?
Standard HTTP runs over TCP for reliability.
However, HTTP/3 is built on QUIC, which uses UDP for faster performance, especially on unstable networks.

7. More about WebSockets
WebSockets create a persistent, full-duplex (two-way) communication channel between client and server over a single TCP connection.
Unlike HTTP, which is request–response based, WebSockets allow real-time data flow without repeatedly reconnecting.

8. More about Segments
In TCP, a segment is the data unit that contains:

TCP header (source port, destination port, sequence number, etc.)

Payload (actual data)
Segments ensure reliable delivery and proper ordering.

9. What are all port numbers?
0–1023 → Well-known ports (HTTP: 80, HTTPS: 443, FTP: 21)

1024–49151 → Registered ports (for applications and services)

49152–65535 → Dynamic or private ports (used for temporary connections)

10. Can we use another port to another IP?
Yes. This is done using port forwarding — routing traffic from a port on one IP to a port on another IP.

11. How IPs map to ports
The OS keeps a connection table mapping IP addresses and ports (e.g., 192.168.1.5:5000) so data goes to the correct application.

12. Protocols in the 7 layers
Application — HTTP, SMTP, FTP

Presentation — SSL/TLS, data formatting (JSON, XML)

Session — RPC, NetBIOS

Transport — TCP, UDP

Network — IP, ICMP

Data Link — Ethernet, PPP

Physical — Cables, fiber, radio signals

13. Alternate solutions for WebSockets
Server-Sent Events (SSE) — Server pushes updates over HTTP.

Long polling — Client keeps making HTTP requests and waits for updates.

14. What is an IP & how does it identify a host?
An IP (Internet Protocol address) is a unique number assigned to a device on a network.
It has two parts:

Network ID — identifies the network.

Host ID — identifies the device in that network.

15. Transport layer connection bridge
The Transport layer acts as a bridge between application-layer protocols (like HTTP, SMTP) and the network layer. It breaks data into chunks, ensures reliable delivery, and reassembles data at the other end.

16. Third parties who verify certificates
Certificate Authorities (CAs) like DigiCert, GlobalSign, and Let’s Encrypt verify ownership of domains and issue SSL/TLS certificates to enable secure HTTPS connections.

17. Gzip working
Gzip is a compression method that uses the DEFLATE algorithm to reduce file size. It finds repeated patterns in data and replaces them with shorter representations, making downloads faster
